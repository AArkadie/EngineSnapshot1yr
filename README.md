For potential employers

This repository serves as a way to view 1 year's worth of work learning and coding a game engine, nothing more.
It may serve as instructive for others who want to learn how to do stuff, but it is not complete software fit for use or modification otherwise.

Things I learned: C++, Vulkan, SDL, GLSL, Signal Processing / Audio Programming, Graphics Programming, Game Engine Programming

Chronology: CYOAMaker -> Audio -> HardwareAcceleration/Video -> Assets/DataTypes -> Mainframe -> Everything Else -> (Current)Revising Audio

If you plan to build/run this, you'll need to link to external libraries yourself and uncomment some functions at the start of main() to perform some basic setup before the first run.

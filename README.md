For potential employers

This repository serves as a way to view 1 year's worth of work learning and coding a game engine, nothing more.
It may serve as instructive for others who want to learn how to do stuff, but it is not complete software fit for use otherwise.

Things I learned: C++, Vulkan, SDL, GLSL, Signal Processing / Audio Programming, Graphics Programming, Game Engine Programming

Chronology: CYOAMaker -> Audio -> HardwareAcceleration/Video -> Assets/DataTypes -> Mainframe -> Everything Else -> (Current)Revising Audio

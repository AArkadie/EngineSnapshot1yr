For now, just have vertex input type on one line.
Maybe in the future will have more meta info,
but it looks like everything else is easily reflected.
Files must have same root as the program it goes with.

none / default / sprite / particle

alternatively, the absence of an ssmi is the same as an ssmi reading "none".

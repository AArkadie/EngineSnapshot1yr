This is where scripts for the synthesizer will go.  Basically rolling our own MIDI, will we include midi as an option?
If we do end up parsing MIDI, we'll need to roll it and a score-equivalent file into a common form (score).


:)

Other notes: We want a score to be the constituent parts of a potential track and nothing more.  There will be different,
game-sided files called arrangements which will change how and when the score gets synthesized.  Not that the score isn't part
of the game but you know, the arrangement is what the designer should have to worry about and actually knows about game details
while the score is the artist's job and is game-agnostic.

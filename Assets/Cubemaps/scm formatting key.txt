So far just have the name and we automatically assume 6 corresponding textures affixed with
_U, _D, _L, _R, _F, and _B

Later on might have some metadata like what kind of cubemap, like skybox vs environmental lighting map
maybe ability to have custom sampler, if cubemaps need different samplers

first will be the shader name used for the material
then the type of texture maps that are used by the material (same names as in .stx files).
then the list of pipeline configs to use with said shader.
So the .smt will always start with 3 space-delimited lines.
After that, any other properties that the material might need to know?  Or do we just hard-code those values into a shader since a material IS a shader + some info?

In the binary, the cache will be appended to the end of the file by the cache manager, not as part of the initial compilation process.

Binary Format:
Shader UUID
Texture type array size , [texture type bindings(uints)] (omitted for now, keep in mind)
(maybe we also need to store pipeline config names/UUID?)
pipeline cache data size, [pipeline cache info](alternatively can just say "read to eof"?)

[entry]
material:name|UUID= shaderUUID; mapType1, mapType2, mapType3; pipelineCFG1, pipelineCFG2, pipelineCFG3

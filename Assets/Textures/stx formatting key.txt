Top line will always be the name of the sampler to use, no extension (i.e. to use sampler.cfg for this texture, the top line would just read "sampler")

[for any map entry, the preceeding line may be sampler=samplerName if the sampler to use for the map differs from the default declared at the top]
[the map value must include the extension for the image to use as the map.]

diffuseMap=example.ext
specularMap
bumpMap / heightMap
albedoMap / colorMap 
normalMap
reflectivityMap /metalnessMap
glossinessMap (roughness is the inverse but I think it's just a less intuitive map so we'll let artists do gloss and convert behind the scenes)
aoMap / ambientOcclusionMap
opacityMap
refractionMap
emissiveMap
